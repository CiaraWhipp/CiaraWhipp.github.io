So far, I am really enjoying the course. I like that the lectures are broken up by topic and are short. It holds my attention better than watching hour-long lectures. At first, I was nervous about having 2 homeworks a week, but they help keep me accountable and learn/understand R better than if there was only 1 homework a week. I also appreciate that parts of the homeworks are challenging but not un-managable. The discussion board is a very helpful resource when I am stuck.
I would have loved to take this class prior to ST502, since we used a fair amount of R in that class, and I had very limited R knowledge and experience. I have already learned a lot about how to use R and what R can do, and I look forward to learning more. Overall, I am happy with my performance in the class so far.
